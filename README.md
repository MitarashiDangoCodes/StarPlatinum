What is the difference between git and github?
Git is a version control system tool. Github is a platform which uses git.

Name 3 benefits of a version control system:
1.) In git there is a history where all changes can be looked up and if there is a problem a previous commit can checked out
2.) It's easy for many developers to work on the same project and manage to merge their changes
3.) It's cleaner to work with it since for new features or bug fixes a new branch gets created and if there are bugs it doesn't matter and can be easily thrown away and nothing from the production branch is lost (Git specific)

Name 3 alternatives to git:
Mercurial, Fossil and SVN

Name 2 differences between git and other version control systems:
In git changes can be stored locally and then pushed to the remote repository, in svn e.g. everything is on the server
Git has a branching and merging model


Name known issues related to game engines (Unreal, Unity) and version control systems:
Large file sizes
Poor support for binary files
